# In the LUP: Intro to GitHub


## Hello World 
better than my useless ramblings lets start off with a quick tutorial produced by none other than GitHub, feel free to make a repo that is acutally usful to you
<>
[Hello World Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)
<br>

## Make Some friends 
- go star the BCGOV GIS pantry to follow all the exciting updates!
- follow each other, the bcgov and bcdevops orgs or somone random like franTarkenton
- Search for repos owned by organization bcgov?   
<br>

## **Optional** but handy and highly encouraged 
If you work in VS code a lot you may want to look into getting all of the GitHub extension loaded up, **heck** I'm writing this from VS right now!
[Using GitHub in VS Code (GTS)](https://github.com/bcgov/gis-pantry/blob/master/_start-here/how-to/GitHub_in_VSCode.md)
<br>

Or if you want to use the desktop application you can get started [here](https://github.com/bcgov/gis-pantry/blob/master/_start-here/how-to/GitHub_DesktopApplication.md)
<br>

## Get Hands On with this repo 
There are lots of ways to contribute to a GitHub repo; cloning, forking, branching and marking issues are the some of the more common ones. take a quick read here [The difference between forking and cloning a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/35849), [Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches), [Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
<br>
To touch on git really quickly, its a version control system, it tracks every change and stores them so even if you do not use github consider using git on anycode, it can be really helpful. Git and GitBash are available on the GTS, feel free to come back to this if you want more context: [Learn the Basics of Git in Under 10 Minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)
<br>

## Oh For Forks Sake
- Right now you have no affiliation with this repo, so fork it
- Once you have your very own fork I want you to create a readme or some kind of text document, save it in the folder 1 Getting familiar with Git and GitHub  [**hint: GitHub uses Markdown for plain text formatting**](https://github.com/bcgov/gis-pantry/blob/master/_start-here/how-to/GitHub_Markdown.md) try to use some aspects of Markdown, for an example this document was written in mark down, can you find how to look at the formating behind this?
- Now you have a beautifully formated Markdown document, you need to commit the changes to your fork
- You're first commit is finished, it's living in your fork all settled in, but the rest of the world needs to see it! go back to the [main repo](https://github.com/ElocF/GSS-LUPI-2024-Hackathon) and make a pull request to have your changes pushed into the main repo
- once your pull request has been reviewed and merged into the main repo, I will add you as a Collaborator and now you can merge pull requests and even work off the main branch
<br>

## We've Got Issues 
I did not spell check this document and I make tons of mistakes, flag an issue in here, from the main repo page. although spelling mistakes do get found all the time in repos, its generally less of an isssue, usually issues are code based when something is not working or there are unexplected errors. try out [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)   
<br>

## File Paths, Sensative info and Secrets 
Although GitHub is all about collaboration and sharing, sometimes you just can't for a number reason; sensative data, UNC paths, passwords, or whatever. that's why (.gitignore exists)[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files], take a look at the .gitignore file in the main repo! what kind of secrets am I hiding from you??? If you are not already a contributor ask me to add you as a contributor to this repo try adding a file to be ignored in the repo? (not sure how this will work outside of vs code or the desktop app) 
<br>

## Main Branch 
Now that you are a contributor to this repo, use the main branch to answer the questions in the markdown doc answer_me_these_questions_three.md
<br>

# THE END
## Final thoughts
> There is so much to learn about Git and Github this is supposed to be quick to get some of the basics in,
> throughout the rest of this hackathon we will be using github so buckle up!
### Final Final thoughts 
>>- do we want to have a GSS LUP repo?
>>- do we want to put up all of our hackathon material into this repo or another similar one? for reference, practice or whatever
>>- do we want to have a GSS-LUP team under the bcgov organization?
